# Project State — 2026-09-27

## Active model-capability adapter candidate — partial production state

The owner has requested GPT Image 2.5 as the first image backend and Gemini
as fallback. The Goal and Git desired state have been amended; until the
protected Combo reconcile, the live runtime still has the prior Gemini-first
order. The earlier smoke/checkpoint below are historical for that order.

The 1.6.4 **candidate** OpenClaw image
`local/openclaw-amadeus:git-02df41443a54-20260927125732` is live and healthy
on M204; no final release/version bump has occurred. It uses
`openai/amadeus-image` over the existing 9Router provider, `tts.auto=tagged`,
and a narrowly scoped WhatsApp/Telegram group image policy. `arthur-combo`,
`amadeus-asr`, `amadeus-tts`, `kurisu-v1`, MP3, 1200 characters, the 120-second
TTS timeout, and the global Agent-facing `tts,message` deny are unchanged.
The 9Router `kind=image` Combo has strict Gemini 3.1 Flash Image → GPT Image
2.5 fallback order; an authenticated image transport smoke succeeded through
Gemini, and a synthetic 429 against the exact live helper advanced to GPT
without a second logical request. No safe live first-model fault was induced.
Router-level missing-prompt 400 returned before Combo dispatch, but the pinned
helper treats upstream HTTP 400 as fallback-eligible; do not claim broader
no-fallback behavior. Router and native TTS PIDs were not restarted.

The candidate deployment checkpoint is
`/DATA/AppData/openclaw/backups/amadeus-openclaw-20260927125732` (manually
tightened to 0700; config and manifests 0600), with post-deploy evidence at
`/Volumes/Avalon/backups/operation-skuld/deploy/amadeus-openclaw-20260927125732`
(0700). A separate pre-goal OpenClaw config/monitor/image checkpoint and the
minimal 9Router Combo prestate support independent rollback. The live policy
projection passed, but **real owner/non-owner group image and three-way voice
acceptance are still pending**. See
`.agent/checkpoints/2026-09-27-amadeus-model-capability-candidate.md`.

## Source and architecture

- Canonical `origin/main` contains the prior 1.6.4 released source and the new adapter Goal plan. Candidate source is on `codex/model-capability-adapter-2026-09`; its live image is not yet a final release. Keep source branch, candidate image tag, and release version distinct.
- OpenClaw 2026.9.4 is the **sole Agent runtime**. Native Amadeus/PUBG plugins, deterministic domain/presentation and one owner outbox remain; no retired runtime, keyword router, custom image provider, or sender fallback was introduced.

## Live release and rollback

- Previous released OpenClaw on M204 OrbStack `nyannyan` CasaOS: `local/openclaw-amadeus:git-b389e869d6a2-20260927084301` (Amadeus 1.6.4); Product Radar `local/product-radar:git-d988000e1c5d-20260924130631`; post-deploy OpenClaw and Product Radar health passed. WhatsApp remains linked. The protected pre-1.6.4 OpenClaw checkpoint is `/DATA/AppData/openclaw/backups/amadeus-openclaw-20260927084301` (root chmod 0700; config copy 0600); post-deploy evidence is `/Volumes/Avalon/backups/operation-skuld/deploy/amadeus-openclaw-20260927084301`. The 1.6.3 checkpoint `/DATA/AppData/openclaw/backups/amadeus-openclaw-20260927082000` remains available. Preserve both for rollback.
- The previous released OpenClaw config had default image-generation model `openai/ag/gemini-3.1-flash-image`, a 180-second timeout, and the owner-approved shared `browser.ssrfPolicy.dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork=true` opt-in. It reuses the existing `OPENCLAW_9ROUTER_API_KEY` SecretRef/env source. No Google key/path was added. The owner confirmed real image-generation acceptance on 2026-09-27; see the acceptance record below.
- The **same** Mac `com.amadeus.qwen3-tts` LaunchAgent serves the original A (~46s) reference with pinned community MLX 1.7B Base 8-bit ICL, `language=Auto`, one bounded inference worker and `ProcessType=Interactive`. Post-1.6.4 read-only host health is HTTP 200/ready, LaunchAgent PID 50062, last exit 0. The matrix process PID 79839 is no longer present. No TTS service restart occurred; preserve the exact MPS rollback.
- The owner previously accepted real WhatsApp Japanese PTT/nonduplicated visible text/typed-without-voice and confirmed no pronunciation/naturalness/volume/rhythm anomaly after 1.6.2. This remains prior evidence, not post-1.6.3 acceptance.

## 1.6.4 image-generation rollout — owner-accepted

- The previous released 1.6.4 config had the native `image_generate` default path through the existing `openai` provider and 9Router. The bundled provider is loaded; `plugins/amadeus/skills/image-generation/SKILL.md` is eligible. The Skill uses semantic intent, with no fixed phrase router, duplicated model ID, or SOUL/global AGENTS change.
- A direct authenticated transport smoke from the OpenClaw container requested `ag/gemini-3.1-flash-image`, returned HTTP 200 and one JPEG (569,192 bytes), and handled the binary only in memory. This does not prove Agent selection or channel attachment delivery.
- CLI-driven agent turns were not real owner-inbound tests. The fresh explicit CLI session's exact `context.compiled` event offered only `web_fetch` and `web_search`; no `image_generate` call or attachment occurred. A factory reproduction under the configured owner sender rule includes `image_generate`, but this does not prove that CLI path. The owner subsequently confirmed real owner-channel image delivery, typed-text isolation, and inbound voice/TTS acceptance: “已验收 一切正常可以收尾”. Treat that owner attestation as the acceptance evidence; do not treat the CLI-only sessions as proof.
- Post-1.6.4 read-only host TTS health is HTTP 200/ready (LaunchAgent PID 50062, exit 0); no TTS or 9Router restart occurred.

## 1.6.2 stability cleanup release

- The historical 1.5.3 Voice remote branch had only an older Goal document and was retired after main-content comparison. MLX source terminology now says selected community backend, preserving the third-party caveat and explicit MPS rollback.
- Native LaunchAgent was applied with private launchd stderr, truncated above 1 MiB before each bootstrap. The previous native source/plist, protected A profile/token and exact MPS rollback remain outside Git. Same A/MLX/Auto/Interactive engine, model, timeout, worker and format are verified. Port 18792 remains deliberately wildcard for OrbStack/9Router; guest-to-host/LAN-address and authenticated 9Router speech succeeded, unauthenticated synthesis/inventory returned 401. No independent physical LAN peer test was available, so LAN exposure is conservatively assumed.
- A real WhatsApp audio inbound produced one media reply with Japanese TTS and a Chinese visible summary; an ordinary typed inbound produced a text-only reply. The owner replied “确认正常 通过” when asked to verify accepted Kurisu sound, visible text correctness/nonduplication and typed isolation. No Docker/CasaOS rebuild or new voice experiment was run. Protected native recovery and real acceptance: `.agent/checkpoints/2026-09-26-amadeus-1.6.2-stability-release.md`.

## Measured limits and operational watch

- Original single DM baseline: ASR 0.702s, Agent 3.471s, TTS+MP3 35.162s, end-to-end 42.462s. Fixed short HTTP A/MPS Interactive 20-run p50 4.48s/p95 5.28s; A/MLX 20-run p50 3.30s/p95 3.52s. A/MLX normal five-run p50 5.42s. MP3 encode remains minor; direct Opus not selected.
- MLX cold/real `vmmap` peak reached 18.4 GiB on 24 GiB Mac; swap rose from ~3.63 to ~6.75 GiB, reached ~7.03 GiB after a post-release real voice then fell to ~6.31 GiB; sampled memory pressure ~70–80% free. Idle footprint ~3.3 GiB; long-term memory safety is a monitoring gate, not a zero-risk claim. A/MPS before switch had ~9.3 GiB physical footprint. B ~15s reference hit four supervised 110s timeouts; its incomplete cells are explicitly documented, not filled with guessed p95.
- Docker cache patch-only candidate wall 39s→3s; plugin-dist-only 1s with OS/glibc/npm cached. Machine-checkable performance report and numeric data are in `docs/reports/`. Full local gates, immutable CasaOS release/checkpoint and owner notification passed. Known `LOG_POLICY=warning` and optional media adapter absence remain; post-release real WhatsApp owner acceptance and canonical `main` push passed. Four B configs remain safety-incomplete; owner explicitly cancelled further B tests after accepting released A+MLX (Goal §12). The numeric data remains incomplete, not fabricated; the performance Goal is complete as amended. Strict doctor has one known optional media-adapter failure; non-strict doctor exits 0.

Use `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` for the next action and dated `.agent/checkpoints/2026-09-26-*` for evidence and rollback, not historical diaries as runtime instructions.
